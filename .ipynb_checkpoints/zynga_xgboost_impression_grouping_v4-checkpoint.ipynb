    "* Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to Amazon SageMaker algorithms\n",

Note that I take a Bernouli sampling of the impression data after filtering out the conversions for a smaller data set of negative data.  This is so I don't over-bais the algorithm with negative data.  Then I take the same columns of all of the conversion data so I have maximum diversity of conversions.  I've heard you want 20% positive data to 80% negative data.  The problem with that is that if conversions are sparse/low then it limits the amount of negative data and limits the diversity of negative data that you feed the model.  I've been shooting for between 5-20% but have mostly been on the lower end.\n",

    "Currently sampling 5% of the table with a 14 day lookback starting 2 days ago (so essentially day -16 thru day -2 from today).  The theory here is to build the model on historical data where the conversion lookback data has been fully baked (or at least for 2 days), and then you would score the previous 2-3 days of impression groups with minimal or no overlay from what the model was built on and what you are trying to score to predict the future.  Goal here is to maximixe the model diversity from recent history with fully baked data to build the model and maximize recency nuances of new inventory and users that are showing up in the past couple days that are likely to show up again tomorrow."

    "Cleaning up data is part of nearly every machine learning project.  It arguably presents the biggest risk if done incorrectly and is one of the more subjective aspects in the process.  Several common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling missing values: Some machine learning algorithms are capable of handling missing values, but most would rather not.  Options include:\n",
    " * Removing observations with missing values: This works well if only a very small fraction of observations have incomplete information.\n",
    " * Removing features with missing values: This works well if there are a small number of features which have a large number of missing values.\n",
    " * Imputing missing values: Entire [books](https://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Imputation-Missing-Interdisciplinary-Statistics/dp/1439868247) have been written on this topic, but common choices are replacing the missing value with the mode or mean of that column's non-missing values.\n",
    "* Converting categorical to numeric: The most common method is one hot encoding, which for each feature maps every distinct value of that column to its own feature which takes a value of 1 when the categorical feature is equal to that value, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "* Oddly distributed data: Although for non-linear models like Gradient Boosted Trees, this has very limited implications, parametric models like regression can produce wildly inaccurate estimates when fed highly skewed data.  In some cases, simply taking the natural log of the features is sufficient to produce more normally distributed data.  In others, bucketing values into discrete ranges is helpful.  These buckets can then be treated as categorical variables and included in the model when one hot encoded.\n",
    "* Handling more complicated data types: Mainpulating images, text, or data at varying grains is left for other notebook templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, some of these aspects have already been handled for us, and the algorithm we are showcasing tends to do well at handling sparse or oddly distributed data.  Therefore, let's keep pre-processing simple."

    "Another question to ask yourself before building a model is whether certain features will add value in your final use case.  For example, if your goal is to deliver the best prediction, then will you have access to that data at the moment of prediction?  Knowing it's raining is highly predictive for umbrella sales, but forecasting weather far enough out to plan inventory on umbrellas is probably just as difficult as forecasting umbrella sales without knowledge of the weather.  So, including this in your model may give you a false sense of precision.\n",

    "When building a model whose primary goal is to predict a target value on new data, it is important to understand overfitting.  Supervised learning models are designed to minimize error between their predictions of the target value and actuals, in the data they are given.  This last part is key, as frequently in their quest for greater accuracy, machine learning models bias themselves toward picking up on minor idiosyncrasies within the data they are shown.  These idiosyncrasies then don't repeat themselves in subsequent data, meaning those predictions can actually be made less accurate, at the expense of more accurate predictions in the training phase.\n",

There are several different ways of operationalizing this, holdout validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, etc.  For our purposes, we'll simply randomly split the data into 3 uneven groups.  The model will be trained on 70% of data, it will then be evaluated on 20% of data to give us an estimate of the accuracy we hope to have on \"new\" data, and 10% will be held back as a final testing dataset which will be used later on."

In order to improve predictive accuracy further, we could tweak value we threshold our predictions at to alter the mix of false-positives and false-negatives, or we could explore techniques like hyperparameter tuning.  In a real-world scenario, we would also spend more time engineering features by hand and would likely look for additional datasets to include which contain customer information not available in our initial dataset."
